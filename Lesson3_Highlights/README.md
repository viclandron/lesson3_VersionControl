## Project Description:
In this assignment, we learned how to use Git by setting up a local and remote repository for our files and how all these aspects work together to keep your files updated, backed up, and available to work on collaboratively

## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. I learned about how valuable Git is to working on a project collaboratively as it stores all versions of a file/project making it easy to track the progress as well as allowing others to be able to access all these files.
2. The local repository is used to store all the files locally on ones computer and temporary versions have not yet been published to the Internet.
3. The remote repository stores all the files that have been saved to the Internet and is what allows multiple to work on the same files.
