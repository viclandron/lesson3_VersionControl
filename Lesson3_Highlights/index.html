            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control systems automatically note multiple aspects. Usually it will be known who changed the files, when these files were changed, especially what about them is new or different. Last but not least, they merge changes to the same file. This system is mainly used to manage these changing documents and has multiple benefits. These files cannot be overwritten as there is a common repository that holds all the latest files. People can work on these files simultaneously and you can revert back to an older version of the file if needed. Regardless if you are working on a team or not, the system will back up your files so you will not lose your files or any aspect of your projects. This system is possible through having a remote repository that allows multiple team members to work along with the local repository that resides on the local machine of the user. All these pieces work together to create an environment that allows multiple users to work and backup the latest files without losing any work in the process. It solves the file sharing problem by making it easy to access with a team that is continually making changes and improving a project.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A git is a free version control system that is designed to handle everything from small to very large files and projects with speed and efficiency. Most people use git for multiple reasons. It has a complete copy of the repository data stored locally on every user’s machine. The great thing with everything being available locally, is that you can work on the project even when you’re offline and there is no single point of failure. The process runs easily and fast and will prevent an intentional overwrite of a file on the shared repository. There are basic and remote commands that allow files to move to the different repository dependent on the situation. This process includes three basic steps. One must first add it into the staging area, then use the commit command to bring into the local repository and then lastly use the push command to bring it into the remote repository. This process can also work in the opposite direction by using different commands. Git is independent of any network and includes a complete history with full version tracking abilities that is extremely useful and efficient. It’s software is free and available to everyone thanks to the General Public License.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The local repository refers to a copy on your local device that is a cache of the remote downloads that also contains the temporary build artifacts that have not yet been released. This is where we make local changes, typically those done on our computer. The local repository is located inside the working directory because it is its subdirectory. This is a conceptual place that also physically resides inside the git subdirectory as well. Files are worked on, saved and sent to the local repository on your computer where all files on your computer are kept. They can be updated as seen fit but will be stored within the local repository.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">In order to have collaboration with a Git project, one must be able to use the remote repository. Remote repositories store the versions of your project that are on the Internet or somewhere in the network. Multiple of these repositories are needed where some are read only and others can be shared with others. When collaborating, one must manage these multiple repositories and push and pull data to and from them when work needs to be shared with the other collaborators. Managing these requires knowing when to add, remove, define and manage various branches of the repository so they are available to everyone working on the project.</p>

            <p class="lead">Github is a web based version of a version control system and Internet hosting system. The main use of it is for code and offers all the features available in a distributed version control like Git but is also inclusive of other features as well. Github allows you to create free and private repositories on the same account which are very commonly used to host open source software products. This website has almost 20 million users which makes it the largest host of source code in the entire world. The site also provides for social networking functions like feeds, followers, etc. along with a graph that will show developers how they are working on their versions of the repository and what fork is the newest.</p>
